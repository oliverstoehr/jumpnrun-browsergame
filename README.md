# jump 'n' run browsergame
A small browser game with 2D graphics and parallax effects.
I created this game as a project for my studies.

You can try the game at http://oliverstoehr.com/projekte/rma/index.html.

## setup
This game doesn't need any specific setup. Simply open the index.html in your browser to run the game.
The game is optimized for Safari 10 but should work in other modern browser as well.

## game controls
Move - arrow left and arrow right  
jump - arrow up  
pause - P

The buttons below the game can be used to control the game on a touch screen.
